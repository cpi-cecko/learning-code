The documentation for this project would be generated by a script which parses
the rules.clp file and the classes.clp file and generates LaTeX output from
them.  It first generates a doc heading from the rules.clp heading comment.
After that, it parses the classes.clp and outputs info about each class.  In
the end, it continues with the rules.clp file and outputs comments about
functions and rules.

Several comment tags help the script generate the doc:
  
  o  NOT-INCLUDE - don't include this line in the doc
